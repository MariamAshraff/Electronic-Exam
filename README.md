Electronic Exam using avr
I recently completed an Electronic Exam project utilizing an AVR Microcontroller. This project aims to create an electronic exam system, empowering students to input their answers (1->a, 2->b, 3->c, 4->d) via a keypad. The system then validates these responses against correct answers stored in EEPROM. To maintain exam integrity, students are allotted a strict 10-minute window to complete the test, with a countdown facilitated by TIMER1.

**Architecture:**
- ATMEGA32
- EEPROM
- TIMER1
- LCD
- Keypad
